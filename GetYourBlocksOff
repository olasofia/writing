First - Get your blocks off!
============================


Becoming the one that you turn to
----------------------------------------------

If you dare to dream, then you must dare to face blocks. Big dreams need the courage to face big blocks. I define a block as: an experience of not knowing how to move forward. Being stuck. Ok, sometimes that is not a problem. Isn't it great when you come up against a problem, and without thinking get caught up in working out a way around it and then find yourself sailing past the obstacle grinning away to yourself? In this case, the block has not knocked us down. We knocked it down! Other times however, we *are* knocked over. We have strong feelings of discomfort. These are the kinds of blocks we are dealing with here.

For most people, when there are no immediate solutions, blocks like these can produce one thing very quickly. Pain. The bigger the dream, the stronger the level of pain experienced when the dream seems blocked.  Unfortunately we kill the pain by completely walking away from our dreams - in some cases for ever. Dreams then fail not because they are impossible, but because we become expert at dodging pain, at the expense of our dreams. There is a gaping hole in our capacity to stay on board and redirect pain. We don't know how to quickly transform it and get back on course. 

We get faster and faster in eliminating dreams from our life to the point where we kill new ideas before giving them any kind of chance to become real. We find safety in resignation and the dead grey life devoid of the magic of our dreams. And we come up with all kinds of reasons why  dreams are unreachable. We start to live out a story to help keep the reality away. It is a form of lying to ourself and then forgetting that it is a lie. But dreams can come to haunt us if we kill them. They begin to exist like a ghost or shadow in our life. (Resentment of any people who are too succesful for our liking) This is another form of pain. And since as human beings, our nature is to avoid pain, and are not very good at doing it in a healthy way, this is where all the mini-addictions in society kick in. The pain that we feel at the death of our dreams is something that we can never actually escape from.   **BOREDOM TEENAGER STORY**

Luis Espinoza said that happiness is revolutionary. Isn't that true, when you see that most people are not nearly as happy as they could be?

What most people do not know is that the block - i.e THAT MOMENT - when we are anxious, despairing, frustrated or in some other form of discomfort - that point when we have been knocked down -  is AS MUCH a path to our dreams as it is a PATH to the nightmares. We need to see - IN DETAIL- THE MOMENT AS A POTENTIAL PATHWAY TO OUR DREAMS.

How we act AT THIS POINT is key to this and future moments. This is **the millon-dollar moment/most potent moment** in moving forward to
our dream. Yes -exactly at this point: where the excitement and thrill of a new idea/project turns to discomfort from a block. At this moment there are 2 ways to act. One is the smart way, and will make our dreams real and the other is the not-so-smart way and will make our dreams remain as pictures of what *could have been*.

But to act smart we need to be equipped. This means that we need to know HOW to act smart. THis article is about the HOW.

If we act the smart often enough, we become the kind of people in Picture A: We get straight back on the horse when we fall off it and *we know* that we will always get back on the horse. We cultivate ever more solid reason to believe in our dreams. Once we know without a shadow of a doubt that we will always act the smart way when we are knocked over, we have a basis to presume that we will be successful. Presumption of success is key to making anything work.

If, on the other hand we give up when we encounter a block that overwhelms us - and if giving up becomes a pattern in our lives, then it is likely we will start at some point to really believe in our limitations. We may even end up as identifying with them. I.e. thinking we ARE our limitations. At this point, we don't just think "I screwed up", we think "I AM a screw-up". See the difference between these two statements? This sets apart the kind of people in Picture A, on an ever increasing scale away from B, C, and D. 

It was a very sublime moment when I realised that I saw myself as someone who had a lot of potential but who doesnt manage to quite reach their
dreams. I always told myself I was 'on the way'. I was always 'nearly there'. I got more excited about 'being on the way'. Ok I managed to do some good things, but overall it was always way short of what I knew deep down i could do. As someone always in the process of trying. I realised - and it took ages to really accept-  that I had a presumption of failure in my identity. Luckily that my real dreams are so ambitious that it still meant that I had something to show for my life but that never took away the frustration and pain of knowing what I was capable of and knowing what I was doing.

This article is about how to act the smart way when you are knocked down. This is therefore about *making your dreams real*

So actually, confidence - (confiding - trusting in yourself) comes from knowing you can rely on YOU when things are uncomfortable. 

Imagine that each time you overcome a block you give yourself a little silver star. And each time you complete a project you give yourself a big gold star. What you will know is that if you keep getting little silver stars, the big gold stars *will follow as sure as night follows day*. Each time you get a little silver star you are one step further in making your dream real and one bit more confident. How many little stars have you got recently? This month/this year?

As you believe in your ability to overcome your blocks, you will believe in your dreams. Why my friend? Because you believe in YOU.

Here is where we get to the essence of this chapter. Now we come to terrirory in which we look at HOW to do it. How to act the smart way. 

Remember the film "The Matrix"? At the point in which Neo has to decide whether to take the blue or the red pill. If you choose to take the red pill in life, this chapter will equip you to stay on that path. 


How to get our blocks off!
==========================

1. Fall well
------------------------

I remember my mother said that she learnt to fall over on the ice-rink and not get hurt. She told me that if you relax as you fall, your body would effectively be less brittle and would hurt yourself less.  

On the rugby field, even as the attacking player is being tackled and falling, he will lunge with his whole body in his efforts to get that ball across the line. 

When we fall, we sometimes reach out to grasp anything that may stop us from falling.. 

I also heard a quote 'There is a moment, when a man is about to drown, his head just about to disappear below the waterline, when he will do a 360 degrees turn to look for the last thing that could help him'

What can we learn from these physical metaphors? In all these physical examples, a big effort is made in a split-second whilst falling, towards somethign that could help. 

When you fall, how well do you fall? 

The future you move into will depend on *how* you fall. The key when falling, is to fall in the direction of your dreams. What does this mean in practice/


How to fall in the direction of your dreams
-------------------------------------------

Here is where the physical metaphors apply. Here, what is important as we go down, is where we place our focus. 

As you fall, remember the urgency. Grab on with dear life to your dream. What does this mean? 

It means - hold onto any glimpse/reminder/symbol of your dream or your goal. Do whatever it takes to bring these back into your mind. Speak to people who know about it. Bring out pictures, words, videos to see them. 

The thing that you can hang onto is to: the memory - however distant - however vague - the imagery of your dream. This is why it is important to set up these 'flags/anchors/reminders' before you start out on any dream. You need to know *towards what* are you moving? What lies after? What do you in-tend that lies after? Of course, this will be goals that take you in the direction of your dream. 

Robert Swann the explorer took time to understand what made his team tick. He had 9 genius team members that did not necessarily get on. When one of them came down with frostbite in his foot and then lost the will to live, he had to know what had made this man join the expedition in the first place. He reminded him of how he had come to inspire young men from his home town. Of being a healthy model for black men. When his team mate wanted to lie down and die, he could remind him of this.

We need to know ourselves as well as Robert knew his team mate. Know our dreams. Because when we fall, we wil only see glimpses. Grab onto like dear life to these memories. 

If you manage to do this  to focus on this magic point, you will generate the motivation and energy to keep going (keep facing your blocks) untill
before you konw it - you are through the toughest part. 

This process is more an art than a science. You must just stay in it until the light comes at the other side.  Further below we will focus on more specific techniques. Right now we are just making the case for staying in the race. Not to quit. Not to lose the plot completely. 

What is important is that even if you do not have the same spark for it as before your fall, by remembering your dream, you will be protecting yourself from the WRONG REACTION. The WRONG REACTION is to throw the whole thing out. This is not the time to do throw it out. The time to throw out any dream is when you have a better one to replace it with. It needs to be a positive decision else it is not made by you, but a ghost of you. YOU need to make the decision. Not your ghost. 




2. Life is movement
--------------------

The second point is to remember that nothing stays still. Life is, at every scale, always in movement. This is key to handling our blocks. 

The reason that I decided to mention this here is that it is precisely when we have blocks that we can forget this basic fact about the universe. Yet this is when we really do need to remember that nothing stays the same. This is not a platitude. It is a fact.

Have you ever obsessed about a situation only to find that the situation had actually moved on. Perhaps quite a bit. 

When we get into a stuck groove, we need to welcome in a bit of chaos in the right area. Because life is movement, chaos is always available! The smart approach is to invite it into the right place. What needs to happen is an interruption to the pattern that we are stuck in. For each person, different situations will trigger them to be knocked down at specific moments. 

class :: box :: "what kinds of situations tend to knock you down"

This is the time when we need to know that- nothing lasts - nothing stays the same.  In the depths of our funk, it is vital to remember this. 

Everything changes. Even us. We are in movement at every level even if we think we are not.  

If you fail to remember this, your thinking is more likely to get tunneled; you will harden the block. You will give more power to the block. You will delay resolution. You may cause yourself to give up completely. You will change for the worse, until you turn the situation around.

It may sometimes seem as though you are not changing. But each time you harden your position, you become that much more cynical in your outlook. The way I look at it, we all have a bank account. Imagine that we have a level of positive energy in our life and that level is K. 

When you think you are not moving, you may be. 

You dont need to solve it... you need to stay in the race. If you stay in the race, you will solve it. 


Tracking your funk, raising your spunk!
---------------------------------------

What proportion of your waking hours do you spend in constructive - upward-spiral type state of mind? 

Give a thought to that.

K.

If your K is continuously low, then your outcomes will be affected. Gradually you become the person in B, maybe then C, and finally, D.

Over a longer time period, the leve of K will predict what kind of outcomes your are getting. If your K is on average high, then your outcomes will be pleasing.
The indicator that you are on the right track is that you will feel great. 

Each time you turn a block around, your K will get a serious boost. That is why those little silver starts are so linked to your confidence. 

That is why it is such a huge victory when you do overcome a block. It may seem I am making a huge deal about it. But this is where it is all at. This is what all the promises of dreams hinge on. The character you become depends on victory after victory over the inertia. 

"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then is not an act but a habit." Aristotle. 

If you can remember this, then you immediatelly increase the chance of moving through your block. 

*Make a big deal of it. Remind yourself that you are someone who turns blocks around.*

What I do is track my K.


CONSTANT STATE OF CHANGE

ARTIFICIAL ACCEPTANCE. 



[The power of LIVNG THE QUESTION. Part of Visioning.

In the Lithiometer clip: 

In this film, the art of living the question is described. 

There is a sense of travelling, with questions unanswered, that we ponder on as we go through time. ]


HOW TO LOOK AT THE BLOCK
==========================

Here is where many people struggle when they consider their blocks. How should we relate to our blocks?

IGNORE/DONT ACCEPT OUR BLOCKS OR ADDRESS THEM?

Many people tell of succcess when they refused to accept teh block as a limitation.

-If we ignore the block then we are not limited by it in our minds. We can just act as if it is not there
-What about the hard realities that must be dealt with as part of facing the block and having a realistic plan to go forwards?

The critical point is - how do we relate to limitations? Do they we accept that they exist or not?

The answer: To navigate around blocks we need to acknowledge they are there. BUT with a critical emphasis. We need to see them for what they are - points on a journey with the goal as the final destination. This final destination represented as the backdrop of the picture.

Ie. The big backdrop is the picture of where we are going to. In the foreground is the block. In the background is the goal. 

Never lose sight of the backdrop
--------------------------------

If you focus - just beyond the block. Then you will have the block in your awareness - and it will feature in your view of reality - but - your route ahead will set a course that clears the block.

This is one of the trickiest parts. Because human beings are designed to avoid pain, it is 

Of course, if we include the backdrop, and ask ourselves to look at our dream just when we have had a fall, this means FACING WHAT CAN SEEM UNBEARABLE TO LOSE.

It is one of the hardest and most painful things in life to experience a tough block and for a while, see your dreams dissolve. But you must keep your heart open to your dreams. You must remember to include a backdrop, a reality beyond your block. You must look again at the image of that backdrop in your mind. As you look at the backdrop, you allow your dream to feature in your future reality.

If at this critical point, you fail to open your eyes, and therefore your heart to your dream - you will begin - even through the smallest block - to make your life about the block and not about the dream that lies on the other side of the block. Why? Because your mind will only see block in the horizon. When you only see one thing ahead of you you can get lost in it. Make sure that if you get lost in something, it is something worth getting lost in!

This is the power of the infinitessimal difference in focus. About focusing your mind on just beyond your block, in the realm of your dream. 

You might not know what to DO, but your mind will be working on this, fuelled by your own dream - a future worth living. This may sound strange, but this is
the point at which you can let go of the HOW.

Imagine this focus is like being a superhero, standing on a building. Throwing out a rope to tie onto the other building. Now you have a path to cross the chasm. You have the secure the path. You still have to cross it but a path is secured. It may still be perilous to cross, but the path is there.

Now your job is to keep this focus... not to let go of the image other side of the block as you engage with the block. Never to let go of WHY you are grappling with the block - the WHY is  embedded in the *image of you having resolved it*

Face again the dream that you just lost belief in. Just lift your head to look at it. Even if your hope and inspiration are in that moment dashed, lift your head and open your eyes. 

This is the hardest and easiest job in the universe
---------------------------------------------------

Hard because of the BELIEF that we will be disappointed (we will deal
with that below).

EASY because of the ECSTACY of our dreams when we look at them in their purity.

EASY because if we watch the dream, we begin to change. [more on
this later]

EASY also because actually we only ever have to deal with what is
infront of us. It is the only thing we can ever deal with.

EASY because the truth is that when we achieve anything, we do it
through using a lot of intelligence. Intelligence that is free and that we carry around with us wherever we go.

So in reality, our job is actually quite small. For the rest of the
time, our job is to *get out of the way of the process.

When we interfere unconstructively we ruin it. 

WORRYING and any negative mind activity are forms of unconstructive interference. We can catch them much much earlier than we normally do. 


How long should it take to unravel a block?
------------------------

There is no saying how long it will take. That is not important. WHY?
Because with each block comes a reward. But the reward only comes when the block has been fully resolved.  And you will never know as you
wander through it, how big that reward is. You will know only when you see
the reward. 

"Wherever you stumble - therein lies your treasure" [j. campbell. Author of
The Hero's journey, which inspried Star Wars]

Again - the blocks present limitations to us - but these are just our
own potential awaiting release.

If you do not pick up your treasure, you will have empty experiences of life. Life will stop making sense to you as it will seem pointless to struggle if for nothing.

Turn each block into a wisdom that one day you can offer to another. There is
no wisdom so powerful as one that comes from someone who has actually
discovered it for themselves. This gives new life to that wisdom. It
seems to me that for wisdoms to be passed on, they need to be done so through real
experiences. As though each new telling of that wisdom injects
vitality into it.  Else if people tell a tale which they have never
had any experience of, the tale itself lose its power, through losing
its subtelty. This is why many stories
need to be lived through experiences and re-told. 

When you in-tend to make something work - thoughts like this are so powerful they nudge us back
towards our goal. 

As we reap the benefits from 'falling in the direction of our dreams',
as we reap the benefits from staying close to our blocks, we begin to
enjoy the treasure that we pick up and begin to see this as part of
the dream already happening. 

Here is where we can unlock the key - see the block as a gateway - and pass through the GATEWAY to our dreams.


So does that mean I can fly if I want to?
-----------------------------------------

class :: box :: Your goal is not at the end of your life - it is spread out into each
step (chamalu)

At each step we may face a limitation. 

Limitations, when they happen are not meant to stop us. Limitations
are just our own potential awaiting release! 

Yet of course, there must be sense in this - if we try to fly by jumping
off a building just like that, then the result will just reinforce our limitations.

We have to actually overcome our blocks - not run straight ahead into
them as if they were a brick wall!

If a block comes up because you are following a dream, assume that there is a good reason for the block being in your life. If you manage to do this, you will be equipped with the best possible attitude to harness every possible collateral benefit. 

If you wander aimlesslly through life without being propelled by your
dreams, you run the risk of trying to do things that don't fire your spirit.

You need to engage your spirit if you want to engage your full
potential. It needs to make sense to your spirit if you want to unleash
your own genius. 

People sometimes wonder - if they should therefore try anything. 

Making sure you are moving towards meaning is fundamental. And we
will cover that in HOW to Dream. 

Meanwhile, assuming that you are "fighting the good fight" you will
sometimes face what seems like a myriad of blocks. 


How to judge what block to deal with and when?
---------------------------------------------

Part of succeeding is knowing when and how to take them on.

How to judge what is a limitation to accept for now - and what is a limitation
to take on, and when, and how...

We need to make the best possible decision for ourselves.



Key Part 1: The door is just a door

How to use thoughts and emotions to overcome our blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How we see - not just our blocks - how we see *anything*
-------------------------------------------------------

One man looked at the prison window and saw the bars across
it. Another man looked out of the prison window and saw the starry
night sky.

When a block comes up - the first thing to get right is to realise 

How do we experience this block? 

Our experience is made up of how we SEE it and what MEANING we give
 it.

So how DO we actually see it?

The critical realisation is that way we 'see' the world is not like a camera lens works. We do
not just get a photographic image and register every detail equally in our brain.

Our eyes are much more AND also much less than a camera lens. The way we see is not just by capturing images.

class:: :: box:: **The way we see is selectively and creatively.**

Most importantly, our mind - our thoughts [and emotions] are central to how we see.

Selective and Creative Seeing: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.Selecting 
-----------

What happens when we 'see'?

First we select - We compare what is infront of us to memories of similar kind in our head and
quickly make up conclusions.

I.e we see, mostly based on our past. 

[future]And then we make up a future
based on this same past. This is called 'projecting'. Like a blank
movie screen on which we throw our assumptions about the future, making up a movie about our future.
And then we are suprised when we are anxious about the future.[end future] 

Why do we see based on the past? To a great extent, it is a useful
thing to do. 

We are programmed that way so that we can do a lot of things automatically. (But when we
*automatically* think that someone has done as a bad turn - we run
into dodgy territory)

We take in the things that have signigicance more strongly - we see selectively.
This part is largely unconscious. This is where the big danger
lies. Especially since it is largely based on our past. 

[we also compare things that are most recent in memory or louder in
memory. Buy bread - buy company?] describes how we might we might, in
the same breath think "buy bread, buy company?" 

Our interpretation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Second thing that happens when we see -  - we add an interpretation to
the image -Creatively

this interpretation may or may not be conscious.

So when we see a block, we will tend to *see* it based on our
past. Trouble is - if it is really new kind of block - our past isnt
the place to look! 

That is why this is the million dollar moment! 

Here is where we can interrupt our normal process of seeing and free our mind to see
what is actually in front of us. - to see it in a way that helps us overcome it. 

More on that later. 

The more the pattern has been reinforced for us, the more we will
believe it and the harder it is to do this - UNLESS you choose this.

How we *see* things and then how we interpret them... will affect what
we DO. Which affects the situation, and can reinforce a negative spiral.

For example, take a sunny day - one day we might look out of the window and say
- it's sunny. Its a great day!

If we are depressed we might say - it's sunny. Everyone but me is
enjoying themselves! 

class:: box:: How we see the day is: - what we pick out + the meaning we give
it. 

E.g It is a cloudy day. We might look out of the window and say- there
is lots of blue sky and the sun peeping behind it. Or we might say -
it's a cloudy day. 

We see : clouds + "everyone except us having fun"
We see : some sunshine + "it's a great day"

If left undisturbed, we see : loudest thing + "meaning we give it"

This might seem simplistic. But, let's apply it to things that can affect us a little more strongly.

Take another example: You go for a job interview. You meet in a cafe
and the person interviewing you does not show up. You wait for half and hour. 
What did you think? How might you react?

what might you state as a fact: What meaning might you give to it?
how will that affect you, in the moment, in the next hour, for the
rest of that day?

How thoughts add a load of crap [take from other article]

THEN - HOW INTERPRETATIONS AND THOUGHTS CREATE OUR FUTURE
CIRCUMSTANCES (by reinforcing what tends to happen moment by moment)

[strong emotions generate thoughts automatically. if they are bad
-watch this process above go awol]

HOW DEEPER THOUGHTS DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENS

Did you know that you have a book inside you that you have written called "Your
Rules of Life"?

Even if you have never seen this in paper, some interpretations become our own book on The Rules of Life

Underneath all the day to day activities are the bigger beliefs that
we hold about life. Imagine it like your own rule-book. Your own fact
book about life, as you experience it. 

-Life is good to me.
-Life works for me. 
-People have a good reason if they don't show up.
-People are basically trustworthy.
-Recessions come at the right time for me
-I do well in recessions

These are the kinds of things that affect how we advise people: they
are the kinds of things we might 

Whoever you are on this planet, you will have one of these kinds of
lists in your head. This is like holding a library of facts and this
particular list will - depending on how well you know yourself- be a
reflection of how life is for you.

Now, here comes the crunch!

If you change the way you see blocks in the moment, you will start to
unlock your potential and ability to deal with them using your full
capacity and intelligence, instead of using rules that could be out of
date and could be setting you up for failure.

:: Class :: Box :: Most people live by their own rules - a bunch of ideas that are out of
date and that set themselves up for failure ::

If you change this list, you change your life.

If you can't see WHY it should work, it will be a little more difficult. 

These thoughts that you hold, 

If you use each block to reveal any crap interpretations, you will
update your RUle of Life Book.


Here is where the FOUNDATIONS come in:

know yourself 

[these will help you be A PERSON THAT... 
lives out of the constitution you want]

Difference between someone who won a match and someone who wins
matches

Difference between someone who fucked up and someone who fucks up.


OK SO MOMENT BY MOMENT HOW DOES THIS LOOK? HOW DOES THIS ALL WORK?


How You See - Your Updated Rule Book. 


THE ROLE OF EMOTIONS.

AHHH! We have a block!

Emotions are your reality dashboard. A little like a pulse-meter that
you might wear on your wrist. As you get to see emotions in this way
and benefit from the feedback that they offer to you about your life,
you will see them as a more than just a pulse-meter. You will see them
as a whole set of dials and settings and flags and warning
signs. Including the thumbs-up sign. 

Emotions in themselves are never the problem. It is what we do with
them that makes them a problem.

Thoughts as feedforward
Emotions as feedback
