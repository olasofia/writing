First - Get your blocks off!
============================


Becoming the one that you turn to
----------------------------------------------

If you dare to dream, then you must dare to face blocks. Big dreams need the courage to face big blocks. I define a block as: an experience of not knowing how to move forward. Being stuck. Ok, sometimes that is not a problem. Isn't it great when you come up against a problem, and without thinking get caught up in working out a way around it and then find yourself sailing past the obstacle grinning away to yourself? In this case, the block has not knocked us down. We knocked it down! Other times however, we *are* knocked over. We have strong feelings of discomfort. These are the kinds of blocks we are dealing with here.

For most people, when there are no immediate solutions, blocks like these can produce one thing very quickly. Pain. The bigger the dream, the stronger the level of pain experienced when the dream seems blocked.  Unfortunately we kill the pain by completely walking away from our dreams - in some cases for ever. Dreams then fail not because they are impossible, but because we become expert at dodging pain, at the expense of our dreams. There is a gaping hole in our capacity to stay on board and redirect pain. We don't know how to quickly transform it and get back on course. 

We get faster and faster in eliminating dreams from our life to the point where we kill new ideas before giving them any kind of chance to become real. We find safety in resignation and the dead grey life devoid of the magic of our dreams. And we come up with all kinds of reasons why  dreams are unreachable. We start to live out a story to help keep the reality away. It is a form of lying to ourself and then forgetting that it is a lie. But dreams can come to haunt us if we kill them. They begin to exist like a ghost or shadow in our life. (Resentment of any people who are too succesful for our liking) This is another form of pain. And since as human beings, our nature is to avoid pain, and are not very good at doing it in a healthy way, this is wherer all the mini-addictions in society kick in. The pain that we feel at the death of our dreams is something that we can never actually escape from.   **BOREDOM TEENAGER STORY**

Luis Espinoza said that happiness is revolutionary. Isn't that true, when you see that most people are not nearly as happy as they could be?

What most people do not know is that the block - i.e THAT MOMENT - when we are anxious, despairing, frustrated or in some other form of discomfort - that point when we have been knocked down -  is AS MUCH a path to our dreams as it is a PATH to the nightmares. We need to see - IN DETAIL- THE MOMENT AS A POTENTIAL PATHWAY TO OUR DREAMS.

How we act AT THIS POINT is key to this and future moments. This is **the millon-dollar moment/most potent moment** in moving forward to
our dream. Yes -exactly at this point: where the excitement and thrill of a new idea/project turns to discomfort from a block. At this moment there are 2 ways to act. One is the smart way, and will make our dreams real and the other is the not-so-smart way and will make our dreams remain as pictures of what *could have been*.

But to act smart we need to be equipped. This means that we need to know HOW to act smart. THis article is about the HOW.

If we act the smart often enough, we become the kind of people in Picture A: We get straight back on the horse when we fall off it and *we know* that we will always get back on the horse. We cultivate ever more solid reason to believe in our dreams. Once we know without a shadow of a doubt that we will always act the smart way when we are knocked over, we have a basis to presume that we will be successful. Presumption of success is key to making anything work.

If, on the other hand we give up when we encounter a block that overwhelms us - and if giving up becomes a pattern in our lives, then it is likely we will start at some point to really believe in our limitations. We may even end up as identifying with them. I.e. thinking we ARE our limitations. At this point, we don't just think "I screwed up", we think "I AM a screw-up". See the difference between these two statements? This sets apart the kind of people in Picture A, on an ever increasing scale away from B, C, and D. 

It was a very sublime moment when I realised that I saw myself as someone who had a lot of potential but who doesnt manage to quite reach their
dreams. I told myself I was 'on the way'. I was always 'nearly there'. Ok I managed to do some good things, but overall it was always way short of what I knew deep down i could do. As someone always in the process of trying. I realised - and it took ages to really accept-  that I had a presumption of failure in my identity. Luckily that my real dreams are so ambitious that it still meant that I had something to show for my life but that never took away the frustration and pain of knowing what I was capable of and knowing what I was doing.

This article is about how to act the smart way when you are knocked down. This is therefore about *making your dreams real*

So actually, confidence - (confiding - trusting in yourself) comes from knowing you can rely on YOU when things are uncomfortable. 

Imagine that each time you overcome a block you give yourself a little gold star. And each time you complete a project you give yourself a big gold star. What you will know is that if you keep getting little stars, the big ones *will follow* as sure as night follows day. Each time you get a little star you are one step further in making your dream real and one bit more confident. How many little stars have you got recently? This month/this year?

As you believe in your ability to overcome your blocks, you will believe in your dreams. Why my friend? Because you believe in YOU.

Here is where we get to the essence of this chapter. Now we come to terrirory in which we look at HOW to do it. How to act the smart way. 

Remember the matrix - the point in which you take the blue or the red pill. If you choose to take the red pill in life, this chapter will equip you to stay on that path. 


How to get our blocks off!
==========================

1. Fall well
------------------------

I remember my mother said that she learnt to fall over on the ice-rink and not get hurt. She told me that if I relaxed as I fell, I would be less brittle and would hurt myself less.  


2. Life is movement
--------------------

The second point is to remember that nothing stays still. Life is movement. This is key to handling our blocks. 

If you fail to remember life is movement - as you move through your block. You need to know towards
what are you moving? What lies after? What do you in-tend that lies after?
When you fall, as you lie on the floor whether literally or you lie in a funk, life is moving on. You are either on an upward or downward spiral. Rarely are you on neither.
 
The future you move into will depend on how you fall. When you fall, fall in the direction of your dreams. What does this mean exactly?

It is quite simple really. have you ever tried to hold on to somethign on your way down when falling? Isn't this completly natural? There is a natural tendency to try to soften the fall. Or avoid it all together.

The thing that you can hang onto is to.

Grab on like dear life. Remember the urgency. Grab on like dear life to your dream. What does this mean? When you fall, as you lie on the floor whether literally or you lie in a funk, life is moving on. You are either on an upward or downward spiral. Rarely are you on neither.
 
The future you move into will depend on how you fall. When you fall, fall in the direction of your dreams. What does this mean exactly?

It is quite simple really. have you ever tried to hold on to somethign on your way down when falling? Isn't this completly natural? There is a natural tendency to try to soften the fall. Or to avoid it all together.

The thing that you can hang onto is to:

Grab onto like dear life. Remember the urgency. Grab on like dear life to your dream. What does this mean? 

If you manage to do this  to focus on this magic point, you will generate the motivation and energy to keep going untill
before you konw it - you are through the toughest part. 

If you focus - just beyond the block. Then you will have the block in
your awareness but your route ahead will set a course that clears the
block.

Of course, this means FACING WHAT CAN SEEM UNBEARABLE TO LOSE.

It is one of the hardest and most painful things in life to see your
dreams dissolve. But you must keep your heart open to your dreams. 

If you fail to open your heart to your dream at this point - you will begin - even through the
smallest block - to make your life about the block and not about the
dream that lies on the other side of the block. Why? Because your mind
will only see block in the horizon. When you only see one thing ahead
of you you can get lost in it. Make sure that if you get lost in something, it is something worth getting
lost in!

This is the power of the infinitessimal difference in focus. About
focusing just beyond your block, in the realm of your dream.

You might not know what to DO, but your mind will be working on this,
fuelled by a future worth living. This may sound strange, but this is
the point at which you can let go of the HOW.

Now your job is to keep this focus... not to let go
of the other side of the block as you engage with the block. Never to
let go of WHY you are grappling with the block - which is the image of
you having resolved it. 

Face again the dream that you just lost belief in.

This is the hardest and easiest job in the universe
---------------------------------------------------

Hard because of the BELIEF that we will be disappointed (we will deal
with that below).

EASY because of the ECSTACY of our dreams when we look at them in their purity.

EASY because if we watch the dream, we begin to change. [more on
this later]

EASY also because actually we only ever have to deal with what is
infront of us. It is the only thing we can ever deal with.

EASY because the truth is that when we achieve anything, we do it
through using a lot of intelligence. Intelligence that is free and that we carry around with us wherever we go.

So in reality, our job is actually quite small. For the rest of the
time, our job is to *get out of the way of the process.

When we interfere unconstructively we ruin it. 

WORRYING is a form of unconstructive interference.


How long should it take?
------------------------

There is no saying how long it will take. That is not important. WHY?
Because with each block comes a reward. And you will never know as you
wander through it, how big that reward is. You will know when you see
the reward. 

"Wherever you stumble - therein lies your treasure" [j. campbell. Author of
The Hero's journey, which inspried Star Wars]

Again - the blocks present limitations to us - but these are just our
own potential awaiting release.

If you do not pick up your treasure, you will have empty experiences of life. LIfe will stop making sense to you as it will seem pointless to struggle if for nothing.

Turn each block into a wisdom that one day you can offer to another. There is
no wisdom so powerful as one that comes from someone who has actually
discovered it for themselves. This gives new life to that wisdom. It
seems to me that for wisdoms to be passed on, they need to be done so through real
experiences. As though each new telling of that wisdom injects
vitality into it.  Else if people tell a tale which they have never
had any experience of, the tale itself lose its power, through losing
its subtelty. This is why many stories
need to be lived through experiences and re-told. 

When you in-tend to make something work - thoughts like this are so powerful they nudge us back
towards our goal. 

As we reap the benefits from 'falling in the direction of our dreams',
as we reap the benefits from staying close to our blocks, we begin to
enjoy the treasure that we pick up and begin to see this as part of
the dream already happening. 

Here is where we can unlock the key - see the block as a gateway - and pass through the GATEWAY to our dreams.


So does that mean I can fly if I want to?
-----------------------------------------

class :: box :: Your goal is not at the end of your life - it is spread out into each
step (chamalu)

At each step we may face a limitation. 

Limitations, when they happen are not meant to stop us. Limitations
are just our own potential awaiting release! 

Yet of course, there must be sense in this - if we try to fly by jumping
off a building just like that, then the result will just reinforce our limitations.

We have to actually overcome our blocks - not run straight ahead into
them as if they were a brick wall!

If a block comes up because you are following a dream, assume that there is a good reason for the block being in your life. If you manage to do this, you will be equipped with the best possible attitude to harness every possible collateral benefit. 

If you wander aimlesslly through life without being propelled by your
dreams, you run the risk of trying to do things that don't fire your spirit.

You need to engage your spirit if you want to engage your full
potential. It needs to make sense to your spirit if you want to unleash
your own genius. 

People sometimes wonder - if they should therefore try anything. 

Making sure you are moving towards meaning is fundamental. And we
will cover that in HOW to Dream. 

Meanwhile, assuming that you are "fighting the good fight" you will
sometimes face what seems like a myriad of blocks. 


How to judge what block to deal with and when?
---------------------------------------------

Part of succeeding is knowing when and how to take them on.

How to judge what is a limitation to accept for now - and what is a limitation
to take on, and when, and how...

We need to make the best possible decision for ourselves.



Key Part 1: The door is just a door

How to use thoughts and emotions to overcome our blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How we see - not just our blocks - how we see *anything*
-------------------------------------------------------

One man looked at the prison window and saw the bars across
it. Another man looked out of the prison window and saw the starry
night sky.

When a block comes up - the first thing to get right is to realise 

How do we experience this block? 

Our experience is made up of how we SEE it and what MEANING we give
 it.

So how DO we actually see it?

The critical realisation is that way we 'see' the world is not like a camera lens works. We do
not just get a photographic image and register every detail equally in our brain.

Our eyes are much more AND also much less than a camera lens. The way we see is not just by capturing images.

class:: :: box:: **The way we see is selectively and creatively.**

Most importantly, our mind - our thoughts [and emotions] are central to how we see.

Selective and Creative Seeing: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.Selecting 
-----------

What happens when we 'see'?

First we select - We compare what is infront of us to memories of similar kind in our head and
quickly make up conclusions.

I.e we see, mostly based on our past. 

[future]And then we make up a future
based on this same past. This is called 'projecting'. Like a blank
movie screen on which we throw our assumptions about the future, making up a movie about our future.
And then we are suprised when we are anxious about the future.[end future] 

Why do we see based on the past? To a great extent, it is a useful
thing to do. 

We are programmed that way so that we can do a lot of things automatically. (But when we
*automatically* think that someone has done as a bad turn - we run
into dodgy territory)

We take in the things that have signigicance more strongly - we see selectively.
This part is largely unconscious. This is where the big danger
lies. Especially since it is largely based on our past. 

[we also compare things that are most recent in memory or louder in
memory. Buy bread - buy company?] describes how we might we might, in
the same breath think "buy bread, buy company?" 

Our interpretation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Second thing that happens when we see -  - we add an interpretation to
the image -Creatively

this interpretation may or may not be conscious.

So when we see a block, we will tend to *see* it based on our
past. Trouble is - if it is really new kind of block - our past isnt
the place to look! 

That is why this is the million dollar moment! 

Here is where we can interrupt our normal process of seeing and free our mind to see
what is actually in front of us. - to see it in a way that helps us overcome it. 

More on that later. 

The more the pattern has been reinforced for us, the more we will
believe it and the harder it is to do this - UNLESS you choose this.

How we *see* things and then how we interpret them... will affect what
we DO. Which affects the situation, and can reinforce a negative spiral.

For example, take a sunny day - one day we might look out of the window and say
- it's sunny. Its a great day!

If we are depressed we might say - it's sunny. Everyone but me is
enjoying themselves! 

class:: box:: How we see the day is: - what we pick out + the meaning we give
it. 

E.g It is a cloudy day. We might look out of the window and say- there
is lots of blue sky and the sun peeping behind it. Or we might say -
it's a cloudy day. 

We see : clouds + "everyone except us having fun"
We see : some sunshine + "it's a great day"

If left undisturbed, we see : loudest thing + "meaning we give it"

This might seem simplistic. But, let's apply it to things that can affect us a little more strongly.

Take another example: You go for a job interview. You meet in a cafe
and the person interviewing you does not show up. You wait for half and hour. 
What did you think? How might you react?

what might you state as a fact: What meaning might you give to it?
how will that affect you, in the moment, in the next hour, for the
rest of that day?

How thoughts add a load of crap [take from other article]

THEN - HOW INTERPRETATIONS AND THOUGHTS CREATE OUR FUTURE
CIRCUMSTANCES (by reinforcing what tends to happen moment by moment)

[strong emotions generate thoughts automatically. if they are bad
-watch this process above go awol]

HOW DEEPER THOUGHTS DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENS

Did you know that you have a book inside you that you have written called "Your
Rules of Life"?

Even if you have never seen this in paper, some interpretations become our own book on The Rules of Life

Underneath all the day to day activities are the bigger beliefs that
we hold about life. Imagine it like your own rule-book. Your own fact
book about life, as you experience it. 

-Life is good to me.
-Life works for me. 
-People have a good reason if they don't show up.
-People are basically trustworthy.
-Recessions come at the right time for me
-I do well in recessions

These are the kinds of things that affect how we advise people: they
are the kinds of things we might 

Whoever you are on this planet, you will have one of these kinds of
lists in your head. This is like holding a library of facts and this
particular list will - depending on how well you know yourself- be a
reflection of how life is for you.

Now, here comes the crunch!

If you change the way you see blocks in the moment, you will start to
unlock your potential and ability to deal with them using your full
capacity and intelligence, instead of using rules that could be out of
date and could be setting you up for failure.

:: Class :: Box :: Most people live their own rules - a bunch of ideas that are out of
date and that set themselves up for failure ::

If you change this list, you change your life.

If you can't see WHY it should work, it will be a little more difficult. 

These thoughts that you hold, 

If you use each block to reveal any crap interpretations, you will
update your RUle of Life Book.


Here is where the FOUNDATIONS come in:

know yourself 

[these will help you be A PERSON THAT... 
lives out of the constitution you want]

Difference between someone who won a match and someone who wins
matches

Difference between someone who fucked up and someone who fucks up.


OK SO MOMENT BY MOMENT HOW DOES THIS LOOK? HOW DOES THIS ALL WORK?


How You See - Your Updated Rule Book. 


THE ROLE OF EMOTIONS.

AHHH! We have a block!

Emotions are your reality dashboard. A little like a pulse-meter that
you might wear on your wrist. As you get to see emotions in this way
and benefit from the feedback that they offer to you about your life,
you will see them as a more than just a pulse-meter. You will see them
as a whole set of dials and settings and flags and warning
signs. Including the thumbs-up sign. 

Emotions in themselves are never the problem. It is what we do with
them that makes them a problem.

Thoughts as feedforward
Emotions as feedback

your heart" Andean shaman (chamalu)
