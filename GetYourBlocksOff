First - Get your blocks off!
============================


Becoming the one that you turn to
----------------------------------------------

If you dare to dream, then you must dare to face blocks. Big dreams need the courage to break through big blocks.

Let's be clear about size. if you are in a mess, then Small blocks are about how to continue ok in the mess you are in. If you are on a winning streak, Small blocks are also how to jump to the next post on the winning line. The odds in both case, is that you will overcome these blocks quite easily. It can be great when you come up against a problem, and without thinking get caught up in working out a way around it and then find yourself sailing past the obstacle grinning away to yourself. Have you experienced that often? In this case, the block has not knocked us down. We knocked it down! Blocks like these are more like an intriguing puzzle to throw yourself into. Some people thrive on this. For the purpose of this book, no matter how big the challenge, if we stay standing up, this is then a small block.

And just to be clear, I define a block as: an experience of not knowing how to move forward. Being stuck

BIG BLOCKS
Other times however, we *are* knocked over. We have strong feelings of discomfort. The latter are the kinds of blocks we are dealing with here.

At this point I want to make a disclaimer. This is not for people who sail through their dreams and are not ever really knocked down by the challenges along the way. This is not for the people who are already racing towards their dreams. I would not want to interrupt anyone who is winning to tell them how they should win! This is for the people who have seriously struggled to get out of their own life-long blocks. This is for you - not to help you overcome your blocks. But to help you to turn your blocks around super quickly, and to go straight to your dreams, in a way that also equips you to dissolve your blocks along the way. If you have spent a liftime struggling, there will be some very special rewards when you reach the finishing line. The ecstacy of this kind turn-around is like no other. I have no words for it. Nothing I can write can ever come near describing that feeling. This kind of turn-around is what I believe we can all do and if you would like to do this, then it is for you that I write. 

For most people, when there are no immediate solutions, big blocks can produce one thing very quickly. Pain. The bigger the dream, the stronger the level of pain experienced when the dream faces a big block.  Unfortunately most people kill the pain by completely walking away from their dreams - in some cases for ever. Numbness follows. Dreams then fail not because they are impossible, but because we become expert at dodging pain, at the expense of our dreams. There is a gaping hole in our capacity to stay in the race, to transform the pain and get back on course. I would say that there is an epidemic of numbness in our society and each time one of us stays numb, we contribute to it. We get faster and faster in going numb on our dreams to the point where we kill new ideas before giving them any kind of chance to become real. We find safety in resignation and the dead grey life devoid of the magic of our dreams. And we come up with all kinds of reasons why  dreams are unreachable. We start to live out a story to help keep the reality away. It is a form of lying to ourself and then forgetting that it is a lie. But dreams can come to haunt us if we kill them. They begin to exist like a ghost or shadow in our life. This is another form of pain. And since as human beings, our nature is to avoid pain, and are not very good at doing it in a healthy way, this is where all the micro-addictions in society kick in. The pain that we feel at the death of our dreams is something that we can never actually escape from.   **BOREDOM TEENAGER STORY**

Luis Espinoza said that happiness is revolutionary. Isn't that true, when you see that most people are not nearly as happy as they could be?

What most people do not know is that the block - i.e THAT MOMENT - when we are anxious, despairing, frustrated or in some other form of discomfort - that point when we have been knocked down -  is AS MUCH a path to our dreams as it is a PATH to the nightmares. We need to see - IN DETAIL- THE MOMENT AS A POTENTIAL PATHWAY TO OUR DREAMS.

How we act AT THIS POINT is key to this and future moments. This is **the millon-dollar moment/most potent moment** in moving forward to
our dream. Yes -exactly at this point: where the excitement and thrill of a new idea turns to pain or discomfort from a block. This is the point at which most people let their dreams crumble like dust. At this moment there are 2 ways to act. One is the smart way, and will make our dreams real and the other is the not-so-smart way and will make our dreams remain as pictures of what *could have been*.

But to act smart we need to be equipped. This means that we need to know HOW to act smart. This book is about the HOW.

If we act the smart way often enough, we become Picture A people: We get straight back on the horse when we fall off it and *we know* that we will always get back on the horse. We cultivate ever more solid reason to believe in our dreams. Once we know without a shadow of a doubt that we will always act the smart way when we are knocked over, we have a basis to presume that we will be successful. Presumption of success is key to making anything work.

If, on the other hand we give up whenever we encounter a block that overwhelms us - and if giving up becomes a pattern in our lives, then it is likely we will start at some point to really believe in our limitations. We may even end up as identifying with them. I.e. thinking we ARE our limitations. At this point, we don't just think "I screwed up", we think "I AM a screw-up". See the difference between these two statements? This sets apart the kind of people in Picture A, on an ever increasing scale away from B, C, and D. 

You might be an "about-to" junkie. Always 'about-to' achieve your goals. This category fits me. It was a very sublime moment when I realised that I saw myself as someone who had a lot of potential but who doesnt manage to quite reach their
dreams. I always told myself I was 'on the way'. I was always 'nearly there'. I would get very excited at the beginnings of new ideas. The beginning of new ideas was never where I killed my dream. At least I would get started. But once I had started, when i got knocked down I would go down like anyone else.  Ok I managed to do some good things so on the surface my life seemed great, but overall it was always way short of what I knew deep down i could do. As someone always in the process of trying. I realised - and it took ages to really accept-  that I had a presumption of failure in my identity. Luckily my real dreams are so ambitious that it still meant that I had something to show for my life but that never took away the frustration and pain of knowing what I was capable of and comparing that to what I was doing. 

Before anyone picks up on the dangers in comparisons, Believe me, I have spent enough time focusing on the good aspects of my life. I am by default a very optimistic person and people who know me will tell you that I tend to put a positive spin on all that happens very quickly. But this has meant that i have also fallen into traps that go with this behaviour, that have kept me from really firing on all cannons. 

The point is to see with lazer clarity, where you are, where your dream is and what you can to do next. This is a necessary kind of comparison if you mean business. Sounds simple. And it *is* easy when it is broken down like that. It is harder to do this when you are in the whirlwind of emotions that go hand in hand with being knocked down by big blocks. Big blocks affect most strongly how we see, analyse and asses. It means that we stop being able to know where we are. We may think we are over the block when all that has happened is that we have chucked in yet another dream and have numbed to it. That means at a deep level we have lost our way. And we do not know it. And when you do not know that you have lost your way, the dream is the firs thing that is sacrificed. 

This may sound very dramatic. I do not apologise for that. There is a huge waste in human potential each moment. All our answers could come from this potential if we could tap it. We are not taught how to reach our dreams in life. I had no billboard with massive red lights around it flashing "LOSER" each time i gave up on my dream. I wish i had. I wish this had been made dramatic in my life. 

In many ways I was knocked down right from te start of my life. I nearly died several times and grew up as an intense individual. Full of energy and anxiety at the same time. I came to see how all our dreams depend on the ability to get up when we are knocked down.

This article is about how to act the smart way when you are knocked down. This is therefore about *making your dreams real.*

Confidence - being able to confide, trust in yourself. This comes from knowing you can rely on YOU when things are uncomfortable. Imagine that each time you overcome a block you give yourself a silver star. (Every cloud has a silver lining) And each time you complete a whole project you give yourself a gold star. What you will witness is that if you keep getting silver stars, the gold stars *follow as sure as night follows day*. You will know that each time you get a silver star you are one step further in making your dream real. This will make you one bit more confident. The stars are from you to you. Not for others to award or comment on. Only you will know the price of overcoming a block. Only you can rate that.

How many silver stars have you got recently? This month/this year?

As you believe in your ability to overcome your blocks, you will believe in your dreams. Why my friend? Because you believe in YOU. Here is where we get to the essence of this chapter. Now we come to terrirory in which we look at HOW to do it. How to act the smart way. Remember the film "The Matrix"? At the point in which Neo has to decide whether to take the blue or the red pill. If you choose to take the red pill in life, this chapter 1. will equip you to stay on that path. 


How to get our blocks off!
==========================

Chapters 1 and 2 cover key awareness points about removing your blocks.
Chapter 3 and 4 goes into the actual techniques for removing your blocks


1 Fall well
-------------------

We will use physically falling as a way of understanding the process of getting knocked over psychologically. The aim: *fall well*. 

I remember my mother said that she learnt to fall over on the ice-rink and not get hurt. She told me that if you relax as you fall, your body would effectively be less brittle and would hurt yourself less.  

On the rugby field, even as the attacking player is being tackled and falling, he will lunge with his whole body in his efforts to get that ball across the line. 

People, as they fall have a tendency to reach out to grasp anything that may stop them from falling.

I also heard a quote 'There is a moment, when a man is about to drown, his head just about to disappear below the waterline, when he will do a 360 degrees turn to look for any last thing that could help him'

What do all these examples have in common? In all these examples, an action is taken in a split-second whilst physically falling. *The action direction is towards something that could help*

How well do you fall? Of course in asking how well you fall, what I am really asking you is about how you psychologically deal with a tough experience, one that significantly affects your motivation. When you take that kind of mental-emotional hit, how do you deal with it?

class : box :: Think about a knock that you have already dealt with. Think about how your responded. What would your typical response be? How would you rate your fall?

The future you move into will depend on *how* you fall.


2. Use the forces
--------------------

Blocks are a dead force. They will tend to kill in their wake. When we have a block there is a force of death at work. Something has knocked us down and creativity has temporarily died. Our life force may not be so evident. We are slower and less vital. Let us look at three natural forces which can be used to take on this force of death. 

2.1. Direction

Fall in the direction of your dreams
-------------------------------------------

The first key point I will make is that when you fall, you must fall in the direction of your dreams. 

What does this mean in practice? What we are dealing with here, is all about how to keep your dreams alive when your motivation is disappearing faster than you can stay aware of or when you have lost it completely and are gripped with negative emotions or thoughts.  

Consider the physical examples above. Then, imagine that you receive some bad news and that suddenely your motivation drops right down. Applying the physical metaphor, what can you do to fall well? 

On thing will makea  difference as you go down: where you put your focus. 

The aims is to train yourself to work with focus automatically. To make some small shifts that have big impact in how you fall.

You see, there are so many people out ther that are on the wrong track. It is no good remembering your dream a few instances each year. What on earth is more important than focusing on it? If you answer anything except for "nothing is more important" then you are in one of the classic traps. 

The trouble is, that dreams slip away UNNOTICED. It is the easiest thing to forget to dream. It is the easiset thing to carry on in life with no notion of what your true dreams are and with no notion of how close you are. If the dreams stays out of concsious mind - better still. 

It is the default status at the moment in our society. I am making bold statements and here is not hte place for me to back them up. Enough now to express how important it is to remember your dream. And when you get knocked down, ESPECIALLY then to hold onto that memory for dear life.

What does this look like in practice? It looks like this: As your mood slips, hold onto any glimpses, images or symbols of your dream or your goal. Do whatever it takes to bring these back into your mind. Speak to people who know about your dream project and who believe in it unconditionally. Bring out pictures, words, videos to see them again and again if necessary. The thing to hang onto is :the memory - however distant - however vague - of the imagery of your dream. We are not trying to awake the full excitement of your dream. But to keep the base memory accesible. There is a very good reason for this which we will come to later.

Since you will be scrabbling to hold onto these memories, it is important to set up these flags, anchors and reminders before you start out on any dream project. The section on Building your dreams looks at this process in detail. Right now we just need to emphasize that to have images and memories, you need to already know what your dream means to you and why you want it. You need to recognise it even from just a glimpse. before you start, you need to have a very strong connection with it because when you lose your motivation, this connection will be challenged. There will be moments when it is like trying to see in the dark. "What am I striving for anyway?" "Who do I think I am?" "What craziness got me here?" At moments like this, you need to know what it is you are here to do and why. The more you have prepared this awareness, the better. You can read more about this In Building Your Dreams.

Robert Swann the award -winning polar explorer took time to understand what made his team members tick. He had 9 genius team members that did not necessarily get on with each other. When one of them came down with frostbite in his foot and then fast lost the will to live, he had to know what had made this man join the expedition in the first place. He reminded him of how he had come to inspire young men from his home town. Of being a healthy model for young urban black men. When his team mate wanted to lie down and die, Robert helped him remember his dream, at a critical moment in time. We need to know ourselves as well as Robert knew his team mates. We need to know our dreams because when we fall, we wil only see glimpses. If a thing is weak, then glimpses of that thing will be much weaker.

If you manage to catch the glimpses as you fall, to keep just enough focus on your dreams, you will generate just enough motivation and energy to keep going (keep facing your blocks) untill before you know it - you are through the toughest part. This is what I mean by falling well. In Chapters 3 and 4 below we will focus on more specific techniques. Right now we are covering the first few important points in order to "stay in the race". 

What is important is that even if you do not have the same spark for your dream as before you fell, by remembering your dream when you may least feel like it, you will be protecting yourself from the WRONG REACTION. The WRONG REACTION is to throw the whole dream out. UNFORTUNATELY this is highly likely to happen automatically. This is not the time to throw it out. The time to throw out any dream is when you have a better one to replace it with. Taking such drastic action - consciously or unconsciously needs to be done from a positive decision else it is not done by you, but a ghost of you. YOU need to make the decision. Not your ghost. 

The techniques in Chapters 3 and 4 will help you to hold onto your dream. For the moment, back to the forces.


2. Chaos

Let's contineu with chaos.

When we get into a stuck groove, we need to welcome a bit of chaos into the right place.  What we need is an interruption to the pattern that we are stuck in. Since entropy is on the increase in the universe, chaos is a force that is always available!  We will go into specific chaos-harnessing processes later in Chapters 3 and 4. The point to remember now is, that in the darkest moments, we always have chaos available to us. We need to be open though. Else, we will stiffen up in our minds and try to over-control everything. 

I see prayer as a means of inviting in chaos. When people pray they have reached the point of acknowledging to themselves that they do not have the answers. They open their minds to solutions that are beyond their current thinking. Whether this is achieved by prayer or by simply directly inviting choas to help with a block, it does not matter. The point is that the door is opened for something new.


"When the student is ready, the master appears"


3. Movement

The third force is movement. Life is, at every level, always in movement. Nothing stays still. Even in solid objects, the atoms that they are made up of are in constant motion. This is key to handling our blocks. 

it is very easy to get lost when working with blocks. In my opinion people in general lose the plot when they get really hit. What is so easily forgotten, is that the purpose of removing blocks is to serve our dreams. No more. No less. It is very easy to forget this when working with blocks. The process can lose direction and then get completely stuck incredibly quickly. Think of the stickiest tar you can imagine. When a real block hits you, it is like trying to run through a tub of that, while the tar gets denser and denser.

Suddenely, it can feel as if much is dying or has died. The process as a whole needs to be kept alive. That is why, when you come across a block, you must remember that at a deep level, you must keep moving.  Keep trying different approaches. These might even all be processes you are familiar with, just that you must vary them. By default- keep shaking up your practice. And as well as moving, remembering to fall well will keep nudging your activities back in the direction of the dreams. 

Again, since we exist to go towards our highest purpose, since the purpose of the block work is to go to our dream, this means re-orienting towards it time and time again. Any time we are lost, turning again towards the dream. This we have described as falling well. Keeping hold of any fragments of the map that tell us which direction our dream is in. 

So long as there is movement there is transformation. We must not remain static. This applies in terms of the mental physical emotional and spiritual processes. The movement may be quite hidden. It may seem like things are not moveing on the outside, but don't let that deceive you. This work will be consuming plenty of calories and if we keep the process alive, a whole lot of brain activity will be taking place. In times of emotional upheaval, there is great movement internatlly and this is what you *want* when you get knocked over. Else depression threatens. On the surface you may not produce that much but if you persist with the inner work, you will eventually emerge with super-clear energy. You will be like an elastic band that has been held back and now released.

I remember once I had a dream that was particlarly potent. It 1995, was my last year at university. I was 10 weeks away from my final exams.  Since the course began in 1989, I had managed to turn around a very low mindpoint of clinical depression and repeated failure onto a steadily improving track back to high grades. I could not get the first or a 2.1 as my earlier years had not been good. But if i raised the yearly grade from a fail, to a C, then B, then A I would be able to clinching a 2.2 degree overall. The grade all hinged on this last stage. It meant a lot to me, not so much for the degree itself - I will likely never work as a chemical engineer. No, this was was far more about the battle I had had with my own confidence. And it was about coming away with the goods. After 6 years, I wanted to also win the outer battle after winning the inner war. So now, the trouble was I was not getting down to study. I couldnt seem to galvanise the energy to do so. As this continued I felt the low level noise of stress rising and rising. I knew that I could not afford to have any slips during this period. I remember saying to myself - I want to crack this, before it cracks me. I was not yet in anxiety but the anxiety was threatening.  One night I had a dream. I was in a war zone, my family were all inside a house. We lived in a kind of shanty town, simple corrugated housed. In my dream I saw warplanes flying over our neighbourhood. I remember the sunset sky - pink and the planes gradually looking more like tanks as they approached. Suddenely on of the flying tanks locked a course onto our house, it came closer and hovered up above it. I saw a disc pop out from its body and a cylindrical shaft extend the disc towards the house. As it came nearer, time stood completely still. I will never forget the precision of that moment. The tank was a work of art as well as a technical powerhouse. The metal was smooth and beautiful as the weapon was deadly. I could see exactly what was about to happen. My body felt completely calm and all the following happened in slow motion. As if I was the earth beneath me erupting, i screamed to my family to get out....As I screamed they threw themselves out...of windows and doors. As they threw themselves clear, the disc made contact with the house and I woke up. When I awoke, my mind and body were clear and alert. I had a lazer-focused intention in my mind. From that point on and for the next ten weeks I was studying 14 hours a day with no let-up. I made the grades and collected my reward. When I received my degree what I knew I had won was the last battle and had brought home the goods. 

Whether the dream casued that clarity I will never know. It certainly looks like it. But whatever happened, there was a lot of activity going on in my subconscious. When the inner work was done, the clarity followed.

Sometimes some physical movement will be a great trigger to unblock thinking. It can work to unfreeze - thaw out our thinking processes. 

The point is that it is a natural thing to keep moving into our dreams. It is our natural way. When we humans do so, there is a happiness that is about living the life we most want. The problem is that when we are really blocked, we are programmed to forget the dream very quickly. This is why we can and must beome people who never forget their dream. Movement helps to keep the momentum and reduce the time in finding breakthrough. 

Move on move on : from block-work to dream-focus. From block-technique to other block-technique. The right technique will work in the right moment. It is fine to keep trying different ones until you find the ones that work for you. You will still always need to keep moving onto the next right one, when the current one is not so effective.

Thinking of it like fighting off a few agressors in a martial arts movie... You might initially try speaking with them! If that doesnt work, as some come overhead so you use flying techniqes on them. Some come from the side so you might use a do-jo. When there are too many, you might try the exit technique!  Point is, you don't get stuck with one technique. You move quickly onto the next one until you are out of danger. 

If the momentum goes from our life, there a danger of getting hijacked by the inner work. We can learn to move on from our blocks.. very naturally - in the direction of our dream. 

Think of running alongside a horse... as soon as we can.. we get back on. This takes priority - above the beauty of the block-removing process. Doesnt matter if our clothes are ruffled... main thing is to be on that horse. This is the natural way to live.

That the idea of keeping this process alive and moving. This is another aspect of what it takes to keep your dream alive. 

So, use the 3 forces,

-Keep re-orienting your movement in the direction of the dream, remembering that that is why you are here in the first place,
-allow chaos in where your creativity is depleted
-keep movement in the process

... you will be ever more equipped to stay on track, to stay in the race.



3. Track your funk, raise your spunk!
---------------------------------------

The next point addresses addresses another tricky way that our dreams are snatched away from us. By the time we realise it, we have clocked many hours of pointeless existence. My apologies if that sounds a bit harsh. There is a hard truth there and I dont want to dress it up.

What proportion of your waking hours do you spend in constructive - upward-spiral type state of mind? 

Give a moment's thought to that. 

Let us call this your productivity index. K.  Let's face it, if you have a clear mind, you are likely to be productive.

If your K is continuously low, then your outcomes will likely be poor. Gradually you become the person in B, maybe then C, and finally, D.

If, over time your K is on average high, then your outcomes will likely be phenomenal. The clue that you are on the right track is that you will *feel great*. 

Now, each time you turn a block around, your K will get a serious boost. That is why those silver stars are so linked to your confidence. 

That is why it is such a huge victory when you do overcome a block. It may seem I am making a huge deal about it. But this is where it is all at. This is what all the promises of dreams hinge on. The character you become depends on victory after victory over the forces of inertia. 

"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then is not an act but a habit." Aristotle. 

If you can remember this, then you immediatelly increase the chance of moving through your block. 

*Make a big deal of it every time you turn yourself around. Give yourself that silver star. Remind yourself that you are someone who turns blocks around.*

I have found that it is not good enough to boost your dreams every once in a while. We need to be energised constantly if want to be someone who constantly clinches their dreams.

Life moves towards chaos. Our dreams,left alone will dissolve unless we make them happen moment by moment. So we need to be able to keep a check moment by moment.



So, as I move forward to my next goal, what I do is track my K. The question HAS to be - how close to perfect are you? If we just ask how we are, then we are doing so with no real reference point. This is a real trap for many of us who have struggled a lot. We don't have our dream in teh backdrop so when we answer - how we are - we are evidently ok. The point is not that we want to focus on the gap in a way that makes us feel bad. The point is that we want to be in a state of moving towards our dream. 

By monitoring K, you can get to a point where you start to keep it up by default. Why? Because you will catch it before it crashes. Because you will start to see the results of your inner work. 

The idea of tracking yourself is a direct way to catch your blocks before they have knocked you over completely. Before they have led you into that semi- conscious gravy-train of mindless activity.

I do not know the figures, but I am convinced that most people live with low K. 


Chapter 2 : How to look at your block: Be inclusive. Flirt with your dream
====================================

Penguins story




Here is where many people struggle when they consider their blocks. How should we relate to our blocks?

IGNORE/DONT ACCEPT OUR BLOCKS OR ADDRESS THEM?

Many people tell of succcess when they refused to accept teh block as a limitation.

-If we ignore the block then we are not limited by it in our minds. We can just act as if it is not there
-What about the hard realities that must be dealt with as part of facing the block and having a realistic plan to go forwards?

The critical point is - how do we relate to limitations? Do they we accept that they exist or not?

The answer: To navigate around blocks we need to acknowledge they are there. BUT with a critical emphasis. We need to see them for what they are - points on a journey with the goal as the final destination. This final destination represented as the backdrop of the picture.

Ie. The big backdrop is the picture of where we are going to. In the foreground is the block. In the background is the goal. 

Never lose sight of the backdrop
--------------------------------

If you focus - just beyond the block. Then you will have the block in your awareness - and it will feature in your view of reality - but - your route ahead will set a course that clears the block.

This is one of the trickiest points. Because human beings are designed to avoid pain, it is very natural to want to forget the dream when we are thrown upside down by a block. We are biochemically set up to avoid pain. Losing a dream is a particular kind of pain that is very hard for humans to bear. The reason that dreams are easily thrown away is that the disappointment when they crash and burn is very difficult for most people to handle.

So when I ask you, to train yourself to go against the natural current of pain -avoidance, it is no small thing. After a fall, after our motivation has just leaked away, to try to look at any image of our dream can be very hard. at this point in time it means FACING WHAT CAN SEEM UNBEARABLE TO LOSE.

It is one of the hardest and most painful things in life to experience a tough block and for a while, see your dreams sememingly dissolve. But it is vital to keep your heart open to your dreams. 

But You must remember to include a backdrop, a reality beyond your block. You must look again at the image of that backdrop in your mind. As you look at the backdrop, you allow your dream to feature in your future reality. You literally give your dream a place in your future.

If at this critical point, you fail to open your eyes to your dream - you will begin - even through the smallest block - to make your life about the block and not about the dream that lies on the other side of the block. Why? Because your mind will only see a block in place of the horizon if that is all you focus on. When you only see one thing ahead of you you can get lost in it. Make sure that if you get lost in something, it is something worth getting lost in!

Focusing your mind on just beyond your block, in the realm of your dream. This is the power of the infinitessimal difference in focus. 
You might not know what to DO just yet, but your mind will be working on this, fuelled by your own dream: a future worth living. This may sound strange, but this is
the point at which you can let go of the HOW. The trick is that your mind, on seeing the dream, on looking at what you want, will likely resist, overwhelmed by the block. We will look at how to deal with the mind later on. For now, it is very important to keep the backdrop in that mind! 

Ask them not to build ships, ask them to sail to the sea Antoine expury.

Imagine this kind of focus is like being a superhero, standing on a building. You throw out a rope to tie onto the other building. Now you have a path to cross the chasm. You have secured the path. You still have to cross it but your path is secured. You have fixed your direction. It may still be perilous to cross, but the path is there. The point on the other building is synonymous with the dream you want to manifest.

Now your job is to keep this focus... not to let go of the image other side of the block as you engage with the block. Never to let go of WHY you are grappling with the block - the WHY is  embedded in the *image of you having resolved it*

Face again the dream that you just lost belief in. Just lift your head to look at it. Even if your hope and inspiration are in that moment dashed, as a matter of urgency, lift your head and open your eyes to it. 

This is at the same time, the hardest and easiest job in the universe
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Hard because of the BELIEF that we will be disappointed (we will deal with that below).

EASY because of the ECSTACY of our dreams when we look at them in their purity.

EASY because if we watch the dream, we begin to change. [more on this later]

EASY also because actually we only ever have to deal with what is infront of us. It is the only thing we can ever deal with.

EASY because the truth is that when we achieve anything, we do it through using a lot of intelligence. Intelligence that is free and that we carry around with us wherever we go.

So in reality, our job is actually quite small. For the rest of the time, our job is to *get out of the way of the process.

When we interfere unconstructively we ruin it. WORRYING and any negative mind activity are forms of unconstructive interference. We can learn to catch them much much earlier than we normally do. Kill the mouse before it becomes a monster.

Again, a block is only a problem when it knocks us over and we are emotionally low and in sub-optimal state. 

Once we can get into a good state of mind, we can then deal with blocks with all our wit and intelligence available to us.

Rainer helps a young poet to do so. By means of reassuring the young poet that he has the answers within and to relax, 


This links to the physical examples of relaxing whilst you fall. You will at least avoid adding to the pain. 

[[The Power of Living The Question

In the Lithiometer clip: 

In this film, the art of living the question is described. 

There is a sense of travelling, with questions unanswered, that we ponder on as we go through time. Here we are invited to submerge our conscious right into the quesiton itself. 

Quote by Rainer Marie Rilke.  In 'letter to a young poet' the poet tells Rilke of his despairs. Rilke responds with "

I want to be you to live the question

We will come to this later 

our job is to help ourselves get back into the frame of mind so that we can truly live the question.]]


Get what you came for (How long should it take to work through a block?)
------------------------

There is no saying how long it will take. That is not important. WHY? Because there is no knowing upfront what the block hides. 
Because with each block comes a reward. But the reward only comes as resolution comes.  And you will never know as you
wander through it, how big that reward is. You will know only it when it finally emerges. 

"Wherever you stumble - therein lies your treasure" [j. campbell. Author of The Hero's journey, which was inspiration for the epic screenplay 'Star Wars']

The blocks present limitations to us - but these are just our own potential awaiting release.

You need to see that you are making progress, as you work through your block. Therefore you need to make sure that you get the reward each time.

If you do not pick up your treasure, you will have empty experiences of life. Life will stop making sense to you as it will seem pointless to struggle if for nothing.

How to pick up the treasure?

Turn each block into a wisdom that one day you can offer to another. There is no wisdom so powerful as one that comes from someone who has actually
discovered it for themselves. This gives new life to that wisdom. It seems to me that for wisdoms to be passed on, they need to be done so through real experiences. As though each new telling of that wisdom injects vitality into it.  Else if people tell a tale which they have never had any experience of, the tale itself lose its power, through losing its subtelty. This is why many stories need to be lived through experiences and re-told. 

When you in-tend to make something work - thoughts like this are so powerful they nudge us back towards our goal. 

As we reap the benefits from 'falling in the direction of our dreams', as we reap the benefits from staying close to our blocks, we begin to enjoy the treasure that we pick up and begin to see this as part of the dream already happening. 

Here is where we can unlock the key - see the block as a gateway - and pass through the GATEWAY to our dreams.

There are countless stories of people undertaking huge endeavours only to find out that what they really got out of it was something much bigger than the actual dream. They would not have known this at the beginning. If you imagine that this happens all the way through life, then PART of our purpose unfolds as we go along.
This part if so beautiful because we only know about it when we have achieved it. It is like a story that is being told as we live our life. It is the missing part of our life purpose that we describe at the outset of any venture. At the beginning our purpose is potential. At the end our purpose is REAL. 
In the new discoveries. 

In a way this is why it is important to award yourself the stars. Becasue then you can show how they completment your purpose. And it will uplift others to know that the blocks are pathways to your dreams. 


So does that mean I can fly if I want to? 
-----------------------------------------

class :: box :: Your goal is not at the end of your life - it is spread out into each
step (chamalu)

At each step we may face a limitation. 

Limitations, when they happen are not meant to stop us. Limitations are just our own potential awaiting release! 

Yet of course, there must be sense in this - if we try to fly by jumping off a building just like that, then the result will just reinforce our limitations.

We have to actually overcome our blocks - not run straight ahead into them as if they were a brick wall!

If a block comes up because you are following a dream, assume that there is a good reason for the block being in your life. If you manage to do this, you will be equipped with the best possible attitude to harness every possible collateral benefit. 

If you wander aimlesslly through life without being propelled by your dreams, you run the risk of trying to do things that don't fire your spirit.

You need to engage your spirit if you want to engage your full potential. It needs to make sense to your spirit if you want to unleash your own genius. 

People sometimes wonder - if they should therefore try anything. 

Making sure you are moving towards meaning is fundamental. And we will cover that in HOW to Dream. 

Meanwhile, assuming that you are "fighting the good fight" you will sometimes face what seems like a myriad of blocks. If your spirit guides you, then you will pick out the right block to take on. Since we only can know in hindsight what something is for, there are no guarantees. 


How to judge what block to deal with and when?
---------------------------------------------

Part of succeeding is knowing when and how to take them on.

How to judge what is a limitation to accept for now - and what is a limitation
to take on, and when, and how...

We need to make the best possible decision for ourselves.

This leads us into the core part of Getting Your Blocks Off.



Chapter 3  The door is just a door

How to use thoughts and emotions to overcome our blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How we see - not just our blocks - how we see *anything*
-------------------------------------------------------

One man looked at the prison window and saw the bars across
it. Another man looked out of the prison window and saw the starry
night sky.

When a block comes up - the first thing to get right is to realise 

How do we experience this block? 

Our experience is made up of how we SEE it and what MEANING we give
 it.

So how DO we actually see it?

The critical realisation is that way we 'see' the world is not like a camera lens works. We do
not just get a photographic image and register every detail equally in our brain.

Our eyes are much more AND also much less than a camera lens. The way we see is not just by capturing images.

class:: :: box:: **The way we see is selectively and creatively.**

Most importantly, our mind - our thoughts [and emotions] are central to how we see.

Selective and Creative Seeing: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.Selecting 
-----------

What happens when we 'see'?

First we select - We compare what is infront of us to memories of similar kind in our head and
quickly make up conclusions.

I.e we see, mostly based on our past. 

[future]And then we make up a future
based on this same past. This is called 'projecting'. Like a blank
movie screen on which we throw our assumptions about the future, making up a movie about our future.
And then we are suprised when we are anxious about the future.[end future] 

Why do we see based on the past? To a great extent, it is a useful
thing to do. 

We are programmed that way so that we can do a lot of things automatically. (But when we
*automatically* think that someone has done as a bad turn - we run
into dodgy territory)

We take in the things that have signigicance more strongly - we see selectively.
This part is largely unconscious. This is where the big danger
lies. Especially since it is largely based on our past. 

[we also compare things that are most recent in memory or louder in
memory. Buy bread - buy company?] describes how we might we might, in
the same breath think "buy bread, buy company?" 

Our interpretation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Second thing that happens when we see -  - we add an interpretation to
the image -Creatively

this interpretation may or may not be conscious.

So when we see a block, we will tend to *see* it based on our
past. Trouble is - if it is really new kind of block - our past isnt
the place to look! 

That is why this is the million dollar moment! 

Here is where we can interrupt our normal process of seeing and free our mind to see
what is actually in front of us. - to see it in a way that helps us overcome it. 

More on that later. 

The more the pattern has been reinforced for us, the more we will
believe it and the harder it is to do this - UNLESS you choose this.

How we *see* things and then how we interpret them... will affect what
we DO. Which affects the situation, and can reinforce a negative spiral.

For example, take a sunny day - one day we might look out of the window and say
- it's sunny. Its a great day!

If we are depressed we might say - it's sunny. Everyone but me is
enjoying themselves! 

class:: box:: How we see the day is: - what we pick out + the meaning we give
it. 

E.g It is a cloudy day. We might look out of the window and say- there
is lots of blue sky and the sun peeping behind it. Or we might say -
it's a cloudy day. 

We see : clouds + "everyone except us having fun"
We see : some sunshine + "it's a great day"

If left undisturbed, we see : loudest thing + "meaning we give it"

This might seem simplistic. But, let's apply it to things that can affect us a little more strongly.

Take another example: You go for a job interview. You meet in a cafe
and the person interviewing you does not show up. You wait for half and hour. 
What did you think? How might you react?

what might you state as a fact: What meaning might you give to it?
how will that affect you, in the moment, in the next hour, for the
rest of that day?

How thoughts add a load of crap [take from other article]

THEN - HOW INTERPRETATIONS AND THOUGHTS CREATE OUR FUTURE
CIRCUMSTANCES (by reinforcing what tends to happen moment by moment)

[strong emotions generate thoughts automatically. if they are bad
-watch this process above go awol]

HOW DEEPER THOUGHTS DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENS

Did you know that you have a book inside you that you have written called "Your
Rules of Life"?

Even if you have never seen this in paper, some interpretations become our own book on The Rules of Life

Underneath all the day to day activities are the bigger beliefs that
we hold about life. Imagine it like your own rule-book. Your own fact
book about life, as you experience it. 

-Life is good to me.
-Life works for me. 
-People have a good reason if they don't show up.
-People are basically trustworthy.
-Recessions come at the right time for me
-I do well in recessions

These are the kinds of things that affect how we advise people: they
are the kinds of things we might 

Whoever you are on this planet, you will have one of these kinds of
lists in your head. This is like holding a library of facts and this
particular list will - depending on how well you know yourself- be a
reflection of how life is for you.

Now, here comes the crunch!

If you change the way you see blocks in the moment, you will start to
unlock your potential and ability to deal with them using your full
capacity and intelligence, instead of using rules that could be out of
date and could be setting you up for failure.

:: Class :: Box :: Most people live by their own rules - a bunch of ideas that are out of
date and that set themselves up for failure ::

If you change this list, you change your life.

If you can't see WHY it should work, it will be a little more difficult. 

These thoughts that you hold, 

If you use each block to reveal any crap interpretations, you will
update your RUle of Life Book.


Here is where the FOUNDATIONS come in:

know yourself 

[these will help you be A PERSON THAT... 
lives out of the constitution you want]

Difference between someone who won a match and someone who wins
matches

Difference between someone who fucked up and someone who fucks up.


OK SO MOMENT BY MOMENT HOW DOES THIS LOOK? HOW DOES THIS ALL WORK?


How You See - Your Updated Rule Book. 


THE ROLE OF EMOTIONS.

AHHH! We have a block!

Emotions are your reality dashboard. A little like a pulse-meter that
you might wear on your wrist. As you get to see emotions in this way
and benefit from the feedback that they offer to you about your life,
you will see them as a more than just a pulse-meter. You will see them
as a whole set of dials and settings and flags and warning
signs. Including the thumbs-up sign. 

Emotions in themselves are never the problem. It is what we do with
them that makes them a problem.

Thoughts as feedforward
Emotions as feedback

your heart" Andean shaman (chamalu)

Your route does not exist beforehand - it is revlealed to you through
experience. (chamalu)

You can but start out in the right direction. And keep realigning with
each step.
